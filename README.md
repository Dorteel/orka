# Unified Robotic Perception Ontology

This is a first attempt to create a Unified Robot Perception Ontology. The current version of the ontology is mainly concerned with four distinct classes:

- Sensors and sensor attributes: Sensors are the main devices through which robots can attain knowledge about the environment. This section of of the ontology details what sensory devices can be deployed on robotic agents, as well as the attributes these devices possess.
- Measurement units and dimensions: The outputs of the sensors correspond to some form of measurements, which are given meaning to once a unit of measurement is coupled to the readings. These classes attempt to classify and organize these readings.
- Object attributes: The measurements of the sensors often correspond to different attributes of the objects contained within the environment. Within the ontology these attributes are organised and linked to the sensors and measurement dimensions and units.
- Algorithms and algorithm attributes: As some of the object attributes are not readily attainable by the sensors and the measurements they provide, different algorithms can be deployed to estimate these attributes.
