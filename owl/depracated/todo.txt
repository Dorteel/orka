Add Measurements:
- If we know the sensor that provided the measurement, add the corresponding measurement standard (RPLidar - millimeter)
- Given the Sensors that provide the measurement, add the corresponding ObservedProperty
- In case the sensor has multiple possible observed properties, add them using the algorithms (Procedures) that specify the property.
 
Add Sensors and Robots
- Given a sheet that has the sensors and the robots, ORKA should be able to automatically associate entities. 

The system creates instances.
- Compare what the reasoners infer using SSN and what they can infer using ORKA

- IoT Lite attempts to tie together sensors with attributes using QUDT-QuantityKind vocabulary, but QUDT does not provide a taxonomy necessary for our use-cases. As an example, it defines Width, Length, and Distance, but it does not group them as corresponding to the same category of quantities
